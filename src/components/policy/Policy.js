          same way as if you visited the other website. These websites may
          collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party
          tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content,
          including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you
          have an account and are logged in to that website. Below you can find

        <p>
          If you are not a registered client for our site, there is no personal
          information we can retain or view regarding yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are a client with a registered account, your personal
          information can be accessed by: Our system administrators.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our supporters when they (in order to provide support) need to get the
          information about the client accounts and access.
        </p>
        <h4>6. Third Party Access to Your Data</h4>
        <p>
          We don’t share your data with third-parties in a way as to reveal any
          of your personal information like email, name, etc. The only
          exceptions to that rule are for partners we have to share limited data
          with in order to provide the services you expect from us. Please see
          below:
        </p>
        <h4>
          <i>Envato Pty Ltd</i>
        </h4>
        <p>
          For the purpose of validating and getting your purchase information
          regarding licenses for this theme, we send your provided tokens and
          purchase keys to Envato Pty Ltd and use the response from their API to
          register your validated support data. See the Envato privacy policy
          here: Envato Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <h4>
          <i>Ticksy</i>
        </h4>
        <p>
          Ticksy provides the support ticketing platform we use to handle
          support requests. The data they receive is limited to the data you
          explicitly provide and consent to being set when you create a support
          ticket. Ticksy adheres to the EU/US “Privacy Shield” and you can see
          their privacy policy here: Ticksy Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <h4>7. How Long We Retain Your Data For</h4>
        <p>
          When you submit a support ticket or a comment, its metadata is
          retained until (if) you tell us to remove it. We use this data so that
          we can recognize you and approve your comments automatically instead
          of holding them for moderation.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you register on our website, we also store the personal information
          you provide in your user profile. You can see, edit, or delete your
          personal information at any time (except changing your username).
          Website administrators can also see and edit that information.
        </p>
        <h4>8. Security Measures</h4>
        <p>
          We use the SSL/HTTPS protocol throughout our site. This encrypts our
          user communications with the servers so that personally identifiable
          information is not captured/hijacked by third parties without
          authorization. In case of a data breach, system administrators will
          immediately take all needed steps to ensure system integrity, will
          contact affected users and will attempt to reset passwords if needed.
        </p>
        <h4>9. Your Data Rights</h4>
        <p>
          <i>General Rights</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have a registered account on this website or have left
          comments, you can request an exported file of the personal data we
          retain, including any additional data you have provided to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also request that we erase any of the personal data we have
          stored. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for
          administrative, legal, or security purposes. In short, we cannot erase
          data that is vital to you being an active customer (i.e. basic account
          information like an email address).
        </p>
        <p>
          If you wish that all of your data is erased, we will no longer be able
          to offer any support or other product-related services to you.
        </p>
        <h4>GDPR Rights</h4>
        <p>
          Your privacy is critically important to us. Going forward with the
          GDPR we aim to support the GDPR standard. Teens Voice permits
          residents of the European Union to use its Service. Therefore, it is
          the intent of Teens Voice to comply with the European General Data
          Protection Regulation as it applies in respective countries. For more
          details please see here: EU GDPR Information Portal.
        </p>
        <h4>10. Third Party Websites</h4>
        <p>
          Teens Voice may post links to third party websites on this website.
          These third party websites are not screened for privacy or security
          compliance by Teens Voice, and you release us from any liability for
          the conduct of these third party websites.
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          All social media sharing links, either displayed as text links or
          social media icons do not connect you to any of the associated third
          parties unless you explicitly click on them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please be aware that this Privacy Policy, and any other policies in
          place, in addition to any amendments, does not create rights
          enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any personal
          information relating to members of the Service or Site.
        </p>
        <p>
          Teens Voice bears no responsibility for the information collected or
          used by any advertiser or third party website. Please review the
          privacy policy and terms of service for each site you visit through
          third party links.
        </p>
        <h4>11. Release of Your Data for Legal Purposes</h4>
        <p>
          At times it may become necessary or desirable to Teens Voice, for
          legal purposes, to release your information in response to a request
          from a government agency or a private litigant.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          You agree that we may disclose your information to a third party where
          we believe, in good faith, that it is desirable to do so for the
          purposes of a civil action, criminal investigation, or other legal
          matter.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          In the event that we receive a subpoena affecting your privacy, we may
          elect to notify you to give you an opportunity to file a motion to
          quash the subpoena, or we may attempt to quash it ourselves, but we
          are not obligated to do either.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          We may also proactively report you, and release your information to,
          third parties where we believe that it is prudent to do so for legal
          reasons, such as our belief that you have engaged in fraudulent
          activities. You release us from any damages that may arise from or
          relate to the release of your information to a request from law
          enforcement agencies or private litigants.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any passing on of personal data for legal purposes will only be done
          in compliance with laws of the country you reside in.
        </p>
        <p>Thank you!</p>

//         authorization. In case of a data breach, system administrators will
//         immediately take all needed steps to ensure system integrity, will
//         contact affected users and will attempt to reset passwords if needed.
