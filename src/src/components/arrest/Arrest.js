        Welcome to our Volunteer Mentor Program! This guide and policy document
        is designed to provide you, as a volunteer mentor, with all the
        necessary information and guidelines to make your volunteer experience
        successful and rewarding.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Teens Voice Volunteer Mentor program gathers skilled and willing
        volunteers for community service. It's voluntary and not an
        employer-employee relationship or business contract. We rely on
        volunteers to expand our reach and support young adults in our
        community.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Our Volunteer Mentor Program aims to connect experienced individuals
        with mentees seeking guidance and support in various areas of personal
        and professional development. Mentors play a vital role in providing
        encouragement, advice, and practical assistance to mentees as they
        navigate challenges and pursue their goals.
      </p>
      <h5>Who is a Volunteer/Mentor? </h5>
      <p>
        For the purposes of this policy guide, mentors are positive influencers
        who act as teachers, instructors, educators, listeners, and advocates to
        younger individuals through matched relationships. According to
        Rochester, New York's Mentoring Roundtable:{" "}
        <b>
          <i>
            "Mentors are screened and trained volunteers who provide support and
            challenge to mentees with whom they interact. Mentors are
            emotionally mature, committed to human development, prudent,
            responsible and adaptable."
          </i>
        </b>
      </p>

      <h4 className="into">Definition of Mentoring</h4>
      <p>
        Mentoring fosters personal growth through supportive relationships,
        focusing on spiritual growth, academic improvement, personal
        effectiveness, and social skills. Mentors share knowledge and skills
        over time, playing roles such as coach, teacher, motivator, and friend.
        This intensive learning experience offers academic and career guidance,
        enhances leadership and problem-solving abilities, and boosts
        self-confidence and competence through coaching and guidance.

          <i>What Mentoring Is Not</i>
        </u>
      </h4>

      <p>
         Mentoring is not a treatment strategy or a form of psychoanalysis.
      </p>
      <p>
         Mentors are not intended to be some sorts of psychoanalysts or
        counselors
      </p>
      <p>
         Mentoring does not include assuming the role of parent, social worker,
        psychologist or cleric.
      </p>
      <p>
         The mentor is not just a source of a "free gifts” or a kind of a
        “father Christmas”
      </p>
      <p>
         Mentoring does not necessarily involve solving life’s challenges for
        the mentee. It however requires teaching the child through the
        instrument of God’s word to take charge of situations and challenges as
        they arise.
      </p>

          {" "}
          <i>The Role of a Mentor</i>
        </u>
      </h4>
      <p>The role of a mentor is: </p>
      <p> To develop a positive relationship with a mentee</p>
      <p> To help an individual develop competence</p>
      <p> To gain experience which will prove useful in other areas of life</p>
      <p> To become energized through a helping relationship</p>
      <p> To develop a network of support for the mentee</p>
      <p> To have ‘fun’ working with the mentee and other caring adults</p>

      <h4 className="into">Effective Mentoring Techniques </h4>
      <p>
        The focus of mentoring is to develop the whole person; the under listed
        techniques are identified and set up as guides for effective mentoring.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>
          {" "}
          <i> Dedication:</i>
        </b>{" "}
        making a commitment in a caring way which involves taking part in the
        learning process side-by-side with the mentee.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i> Investing:</i>
        </b>{" "}
        mentors ought to invest time, energy and resources in other to achieve
        desired developmental change in the lives of their mentees. Investing is
        necessary when one knows that what one says may not be understood or
        even acceptable to learners at first but will make sense and have value
        to the mentee when a significant relationship has been developed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i> Catalyzing:</i>
        </b>{" "}
        as an agent of positive change, one should thrust one’s mentee right
        into positive change, thereby provoking a different thought pattern and
        re-ordering of values{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>  Practicality:</i>
        </b>{" "}
        this simply requires that mentors live by example; it involves
        practicing what one teaches.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i> Harvesting:</i>
        </b>{" "}
        at the end of the mentoring session, the mentor focuses on "picking the
        ripe fruit": here, the mentor gives a detailed progress report of
        significant lessons taught and lessons learnt. The primary questions
        here are:<b>"What has the mentee learnt?", "How useful is it?"</b>
      </p>
      <h4 className="into">Vision Statement </h4>
      <p>
        The vision of the Volunteer mentor program as instituted by the Teens
        Voice is to achieve our set objective as an organization and to raise
        godly teens with strong moral character which is centered on the
        principles of God’s word as taught in the BIBLE.{" "}
      </p>
      <h4 className="into">Aims</h4>
      <p>This program aims to: </p>
      <p>
        - Facilitate the development of new skills, and also improve existing
        skills and interests of individual member of our community
      </p>
      <p>- Build positive character and foster spiritual growth </p>
      <p>
        - Develop a supportive, caring and non-judgmental relationship which
        will encourage personal growth{" "}
      </p>
      <p>- Help the teen explore and plan his/her career </p>
      <p>
        - Offer the teen the opportunity of acquiring new knowledge, social and
        learning experience{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        - Build on and develop self esteem, communication and interpersonal
        skills through ongoing interaction and socialization.
      </p>
      <p>- Provide individual attention to the young person</p>
      <p>
        - Provide the teens with healthy options for dealing with life
        experiences.
      </p>

      <h4 className="into">Policies (Guiding Principles)</h4>
      <p>
        It is important volunteer mentor seek to understand the goals of every
        given opportunity to mentor and not undermine the young adult’s capacity
        to make his or her own decisions. Though young and tender, they have
        rights that must be respected and protected.{" "}
      </p>

      <h4>
        <b>
          <i>
            {" "}
            <u>Confidentiality</u>{" "}
          </i>
        </b>
      </h4>

      <p>
        Confidentiality in this context connotes the restriction of certain type
        of information. In the course of the mentoring program, mentors would
        probably have access to certain information about their mentees or team,
        it is however required that mentors treat such information with high
        degree of confidentiality.
      </p>

      <h4>
        <u>
          <b>
            <i>Welfare and Safety </i>
          </b>
        </u>
      </h4>

      <p>
        Promoting the welfare of our members will, in many cases, require that
        mentors build rapport not only with their mentees, but also with the
        mentees’ primary caregivers so that they may develop an understanding of
        the family’s belief systems and expectations for the child. A mentor
        also{" "}
        <b>
          <u>has the obligation to do no harm. </u>
        </b>
        This encompasses the more extreme forms of harmful behavior, such as
        sexual harassment, abuse and exploitation.
      </p>

      <h4>
        <u>
          <b> Trust and Responsibility</b>
        </u>
      </h4>

      <p>
        For volunteer mentors, this involves being aware of one’s
        responsibilities for meeting frequency as stipulated by the program.
        Trust, is a key component of effective mentoring relationships. Honesty,
        promise keeping, and relationship longevity underlie trust.{" "}
      </p>

      <h4>
        {" "}
        <u>
          <i>
            <b>Integrity</b>
          </i>
        </u>
      </h4>

      <p>
        This related principle highlights the obligation of mentors to be
        thoughtful and forthright about the commitments (i.e., time, financial)
        to the relationship and to avoid setting up false expectations. Mentors
        should be reminded about the importance of their obligations to their
        mentees, as well as the meaning that is placed on plans and events such
        that even minor disappointments and delay can accumulate in ways that
        erode trust and closeness. Mentors are expected to bear the greater
        responsibility for finding ways to effectively and consistently
        communicate with their mentees, to honor plans and commitments and to
        seek guidance and consultation from mentoring program staff should they
        find that they are unable to do so.{" "}
      </p>

      <h4 className="into">Expected Program Outcome</h4>
      <p>
        At the end of the mentoring program, the following outcomes are expected
        of the child to be seen in the child;{" "}
